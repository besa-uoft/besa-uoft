## Halloween Movie Night

Hello BME-ers!

Thanks to those who have submitted to our picture competition so far! Keep them coming!

To continue with the Halloween Spirit, we are psyched to announce that we will be holding an online movie night at 7pm on Oct. 30th. Let us all meet in the Zoom chat room (link below) and afterwards, those with Netflix will branch off to watch the movie Insidious and those with Amazon will watch The Blair Witch Project. No registration needed but do make sure to download ‚ÄúScener‚Äù if you plan to watch on Netflix and "TwoSeven" if you plan to watch on Amazon Prime.

Looking forward to seeing everyone!
