To address racism and discrimination within the university, GECoS is calling for passionate volunteers to form our new Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion Commission (no experience necessary!). The purpose of this group is to bring a diverse group of grad students together who want to work on EDI and anti-racism initiatives in a supportive and impactful space. The group will create their own action items/recommendations and will be supported by GECoS; the Engineering Equity, Diversity, Inclusion Action Group; and the Dean's Office.
