## Halloween Picture Contest

Hello BME-ers!

We hope you have all had a successful start to the semester. Thank you to those who attended O-Week!

Surely everybody is looking forward to Halloween, and with that we’re excited to announce that we’ll be holding a picture competition!

Send us your spookiest picture by Oct. 29th ([besa.bme@utoronto.ca](besa.bme@utoronto.ca)) and on Halloween day we’ll all vote on our favorites! The top three finishers will get a 30, 20 and 10$ gift card of their choice.

Pictures can be anything from a costume (present or past), decorations, or Halloween art! Make sure to factor creativity and spooooookiness into your submissions.

Looking forward to seeing everyone’s Halloween spirit!
