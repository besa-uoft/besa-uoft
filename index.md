## Join the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Commission!
To address racism and discrimination within the university, GECoS is calling for passionate volunteers to form our new Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion Commission (no experience necessary!). The purpose of this group is to bring a diverse group of grad students together who want to work on EDI and anti-racism initiatives in a supportive and impactful space. The group will create their own action items/recommendations and will be supported by GECoS; the Engineering Equity, Diversity, Inclusion Action Group; and the Dean's Office. Fill out this form to join. Let's create an actively anti-racist and inclusive environment for everyone! As a starting point, here is an article with 10 things we can do to support Black students, staff, and faculty in our university. Any questions/comments, please send them to gecos.utoronto.ca.
