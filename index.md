## Join the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Commission!
To address racism and discrimination within the university, GECoS is calling for passionate volunteers to form our new Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion Commission (no experience necessary!). The purpose of this group is to bring a diverse group of grad students together who want to work on EDI and anti-racism initiatives in a supportive and impactful space. The group will create their own action items/recommendations and will be supported by GECoS; the Engineering Equity, Diversity, Inclusion Action Group; and the Dean's Office. Fill out [this](https://utoronto.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e40ad4f7528711b59d6b11525&id=a2cd356668&e=446505edb8) form to join. Let's create an actively anti-racist and inclusive environment for everyone! As a starting point, here is an article with 10 things we can do to support Black students, staff, and faculty in our university. Any questions/comments, please send them to [gecos.utoronto.ca](https://utoronto.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e40ad4f7528711b59d6b11525&id=3f759cfbcb&e=446505edb8).
